1) In 2023, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) total losses reported to the IC3 
by those over the age of 60 topped $3.4 billion, an almost 11% increase in
reported losses from 2022.
2) In Spain, the number of fraud complaints to the Bank of Spain doubled in 2022, reaching 10,361 cases of fraud.
3) In Spain, one in three people over 65 has been a victim of at least one cybercrime.

  st.info('''
Our targeted users represent the elderly with +65 years of age , who balance technology use with
traditional banking needs and have significant interaction with family and community activities.

Tech-Savvy and Non-Tech savvy users are considered, given that even with sufficient knowledge, anyone can be vulnerable 
while having their guard down. 

Look at Ram√≥n Artal, 71 years old and resident of Sant Feliu de Llobregat (Barcelona), 
who has a background in engineering, is a tech-savvy person and has been close to falling victim to a digital scam

st.markdown('**Our solution**')
st.info('''
Our value proposition is clear: elders and small banks/insurers can significantly reduce fraud-related losses and
enhance customer trust by implementing our fraud detection algorithm. This solution is cost-
effective and easy to integrate, offering robust protection against fraudulent transactions.
