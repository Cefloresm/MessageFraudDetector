    st.code('''Dear Friend, I am Mr. Ben Suleman a custom officer and work as Assistant controller of the Customs and Excise department Of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs stationed at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos-Nigeria. After the sudden death of the former Head of state of Nigeria General Sanni Abacha on June 8th 1998 his aides and immediate members of his family were arrested while trying to escape from Nigeria in a Chartered jet to Saudi Arabia with 6 trunk boxes Marked "Diplomatic Baggage". Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00(One Hundred and Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars). I declared only (5) five boxes to the government and withheld one (1) in my custody containing the sum of (US$30,000,000.00) Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting to US$55 Billion Dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as "Precious Stones and Jewellry" in other that its content will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we (myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. However as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account cannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money. Therefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to move the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries" which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. This business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction. Expecting your response urgently. Best regards, Mr. Ben Suleman

st.info('**FAQ**')
st.markdown('''
**1.** **How would user data be protected with this fraud detector** **?**

User data protection is a top priority for this solution. The product would employ data encryption and adhere to local data regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as principal regulatory framework in the E.U. and United Kingdom, which has also been an inspiration for future statutes to be created by nations like the U.S. With GDPR, ‚Äúindividuals effectively own their personal information and thus presumptively have the legal right to control it, and who can use it is a matter for them to decide (Reuters, 2023)‚Äù 

For the present application, this means that users would have the possibility to decide how their data is used.
It is important to remark that allowing the use of their data means that the algorithm can make their lives safer by identifying and learning from harmful attempts of fraud (a nice trade-off for a better service).


**2.** **Why is the prediction ‚Äúnot fraud‚Äù if it is actually a fraudulent message** **?**

Like all models, the one used in this scenario is not 100% accurate and can be further improved in the next prototype iterations with what we could call ‚Äúthe obvious‚Äù, which are no-sense checks that can be spotted by anyone paying attention, e.g.:
- A person claiming to be a customer support agent of private bank but with a ‚Äú@gmail.com‚Äù email address.
- A parcel delivery provider with a different number than the one found on official websites.

In this first iteration, these no-sense checks are reminded to the user even though the prediction is "no fraud" to ensure maximum protection.


**3.** **How would users receive alerts if fraudulent activity is detected** **?**

Alerts would be sent directly to the user‚Äôs device or both the user and a designated caregiver, depending on the setup. These alerts can be received via email or SMS, providing immediate information about potential fraud.

1. Debugging and improve model functionality by including no-sense checks mentioned above.

2. Testing the economic viability of the solution. How to monetize it? Who would pay for the solution: users to directly avoid the risk or insurance companies to reduce their no. of claims and therefore their loss ratio? 

3. Testing the technical feasibility of rolling out this solution to users.
